# DEPRECATED - Do Not Use

This directory (`v-alpha/`) contains legacy prototype code that has been superseded by the production implementation in `v1/`.

## Status

- **Status**: Deprecated
- **Replacement**: See `/v1/` for the current, maintained codebase
- **Do not**: Add new features, fix bugs, or reference this code
- **This code**: May be removed in a future cleanup

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent working on this project:

1. **Ignore this directory** - All work should be done in `v1/`
2. **Do not import** from v-alpha modules
3. **Do not use** as reference for patterns - `v1/` has the correct architecture
4. **Historical only** - This exists only for reference during the transition period

## History

This was the initial prototype that explored the raw block storage architecture. The concepts were validated here and then properly implemented in `v1/`.
