# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Documentation Style

### NO Emojis (except classic unicode)

**Allowed:**
- ✓ (checkmark)
- ✗ (X mark)

**NEVER use colorful emojis:**
- ✅ ❌ ⚠️ 🎉 🎯 🚧 📝 🤖 💡 🔧 🔑 📱 💻 🌐 etc.
- Replace ⚠️ with "WARNING:"

### NO Hype Language or Superlatives

This project values practical, matter-of-fact documentation. Avoid platonic ideals of completion, achievement, and perfection.

**NEVER use:**
- Completion language: SUCCESS, COMPLETE, FINAL, ACHIEVED, completed successfully
- Superlatives: fully, comprehensive, exhaustive, perfect, flawless, seamless, effortless
- Hype words: production-ready, bulletproof, robust, powerful, advanced, proven

**Use instead:**
- "done" not "COMPLETE" or "SUCCESS"
- "working" not "ACHIEVED" or "production-ready"
- "current" not "FINAL"
- Plain form not "successfully" (e.g., "imported" not "imported successfully")
- "detailed" not "comprehensive"
- "accurate" not "perfect"
- "reliable" not "bulletproof" or "robust"
- "useful" not "powerful"
- "additional" not "advanced"

**Examples:**

Bad:
```
✅ Import completed successfully!
🎯 Production-ready bulletproof system
Fully comprehensive feature set achieved
```

Good:
```
✓ Import done
Working system
Detailed feature set
```

## Code Style

- Matter-of-fact error messages
- Direct status reporting without celebration
- Avoid excitement or enthusiasm in output

## Why

The author is not about hype, perfection framing, or completion fetishes. Documentation should be practical and straightforward.
