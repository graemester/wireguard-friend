# WireGuard Friend

**Build and manage reliable Wireguard networks.  Learn and have fun!**

WireGuard Friend helps you establish sophisticated WireGuard network topologies with a coordination server, subnet routers, and client peers. Import existing configurations or build from scratch, manage access levels, rotate keys, and deploy to servers—all through an intuitive command-line interface.  It can work from a setup you already have or help you build a complete set of configs from

## What It Builds For You

WireGuard Friend establishes this network architecture:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │  Coordination Server │  (Cloud VPS)
                    │  Public: 1.2.3.4     │
                    │  VPN: 10.20.0.1      │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘

   └────┬─────┘                                  └──────────┘
        │                                          • Laptops
   192.168.1.0/24                                 • Phones
   (LAN devices)                                   • Tablets
```

### Network Components

**Coordination Server (CS)**
- Cloud VPS or dedicated server with public IP
- Central hub of your WireGuard network
- All peers connect here for routing
- Deployed and managed via SSH

**Subnet Routers (SN)**
- WireGuard peers that advertise LAN networks
- Gateway between VPN and home/office networks
- Handle NAT, forwarding, and firewall rules
- Support for multiple sites

**Client Peers**
- Individual devices (laptops, phones, tablets)
- Configurable access levels (full, VPN-only, LAN-only, custom)
- QR code generation for mobile setup
- Automatic IP allocation

## What Problems It Solves

### For EXISTING WireGuard Networks

You already have WireGuard running but:
- Key rotation requires manual config editing
- Adding peers means editing files on the server
- Managing access levels is error-prone
- No centralized view of your network
- Deployment is manual SSH + file copying

**WireGuard Friend fixes this:**
- Import your existing configs into SQLite database
- Rotate keys through interactive menu
- Create/delete peers with automatic config updates
- Manage access levels without editing configs
- One-command SSH deployment with backups

### For NEW WireGuard Networks

You want to build a WireGuard network but:
- Hub-and-spoke topology is complex to plan
- IP allocation across subnet routers is tedious
- PostUp/PostDown rules are hard to get right
- No template for coordination server setup
- Mobile device onboarding is manual

**WireGuard Friend helps:**
- Wizard mode for creating configs from scratch
- Structured approach to network topology
- Automatic IP allocation for all peers
- Subnet router setup with default NAT rules
- QR code generation for mobile devices
- SSH deployment automation

**Wizard mode:** If `import/` is empty, the onboard script **offers to create a network from scratch** through an interactive wizard.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Remote Access to Home/Office**

**Setup:**
- Cloud VPS as coordination server
- Subnet router at home/office
- Client devices (laptop, phone, tablet)

**What you get:**
- Access home devices from anywhere
- Secure tunnel for internet browsing

- Key rotation for compromised devices

### 4. **Hybrid Cloud + On-Premise**

**Setup:**
- Cloud VPS as coordination server
- Subnet router at data center/office location #1
- Subnet router at office location #2
- Employee laptops + cloud services

**What you get:**
- Cloud services can reach on-premise resources
- Employees can access both cloud and on-premise
- Secure inter-site communication
- Managed access levels per user/service

## Key Capabilities

### Import & Manage Existing Configs

```bash
# Import your existing WireGuard configs
./wg-friend-onboard.py --import-dir import/ --yes

# Database now contains:
# - Coordination server with all settings
# - Subnet routers with advertised networks
# - Client peers with access levels
# - All PostUp/PostDown rules preserved
```

The import process preserves everything exactly as-is - no data loss, no reformatting.

### Interactive Maintenance

```bash
./wg-friend-maintain.py

# Menu-driven interface for:
# [1] Manage Coordination Server - view, export, deploy
# [2] Manage Subnet Routers - configs, key rotation
# [3] Manage Peers - QR codes, keys, access, delete
# [4] Create New Peer - auto IP allocation
# [5] List All Entities - network overview
# [6] Deploy Configs - SSH deployment
```

### Access Level Management

Control what each peer can reach:

| Level | Networks | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `full_access` | VPN + all LANs | IT staff, administrators |
| `vpn_only` | VPN network only | Contractors, guests |
| `lan_only` | VPN + specific LANs | Remote workers |
| `custom` | User-defined | IoT, restricted devices |

Change access levels through maintenance menu - configs update automatically.

### Key Rotation

Rotate a compromised peer's keys:
1. Select peer in maintenance menu
2. Choose "Rotate Keys"
3. New keypair generated
4. Peer's client config updated
5. Coordination server peer entry updated
6. Deploy both configs

Both sides stay in sync - no manual editing.

### Mobile Device Support

Add a phone or tablet:
1. Create new peer (auto-assigned IPs)
2. Generate QR code
3. Scan with WireGuard mobile app
4. Deploy updated coordination server config
5. Device is connected

No typing long keys or IPs on mobile keyboards.

### SSH Deployment

Deploy configs to servers:
- Automatic backup of existing config
- Upload via SSH
- Set proper permissions (600)
- Optional WireGuard service restart
- Works with any SSH-accessible server

## Quick Start

### Create New Network (Wizard Mode)

```bash
# Run with empty import directory
./wg-friend-onboard.py

# Wizard will ask:
# → Create new WireGuard network from scratch? [y/N]: y
# → Walks through:
#    • Coordination server setup
#    • Subnet routers (optional, with default NAT rules)
#    • Client peers (optional)
# → Generates configs in import/
# → Automatically proceeds with import
```

### Import Existing Network

```bash
# 1. Place your configs in import/
cp /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf import/coordination.conf
cp ~/configs/*.conf import/

# 2. Import into database
./wg-friend-onboard.py --import-dir import/ --yes

# 3. Verify import
./wg-friend-maintain.py
# → [5] List All Entities

# 4. View generated configs
ls -la output/
```

### Add a New Peer

```bash
./wg-friend-maintain.py

# [4] Create New Peer
# → Name: alice-laptop
# → Auto-assigned: 10.66.0.25, fd66:6666::25
# → Access: [1] Full access
# → Generate QR code: Yes

# Result:
# - output/alice-laptop.conf (client config)
# - output/alice-laptop-qr.png (QR code)
# - Coordination server updated in database

# [1] Manage Coordination Server → [3] Deploy
# → Uploads new config to VPS
```

### Rotate Compromised Keys

```bash
./wg-friend-maintain.py

# [3] Manage Peers → Select peer → [3] Rotate Keys
# → New keypair generated
# → Client config updated
# → CS config updated

# Deploy both:
# 1. Export peer config and send to user
# 2. Deploy CS config to server
```

## Technical Details

### Storage Architecture

WireGuard Friend stores configurations in two forms:

1. **Text blocks** - Original configuration text
2. **Structured data** - Extracted fields (IPs, keys, networks) for queries

### PostUp/PostDown Rules

Subnet router firewall rules are stored as text:
- IP forwarding settings
- NAT/Masquerading rules
- MSS clamping for PMTU
- Port forwarding
- Custom iptables rules

Import preserves your exact rules. No risk of modification or loss.

### Database Schema

SQLite database with tables for:
- Coordination server (endpoint, networks, SSH info)
- Subnet routers (with advertised LAN networks)
- Peers (with access levels and client configs)
- Peer ordering (maintains original config order)
- PostUp/PostDown rules (stored separately)

Query with standard SQL:
```bash
sqlite3 wg-friend.db "SELECT name, ipv4_address, access_level FROM peer;"
```
